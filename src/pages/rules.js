                Our venue is in the gym of the Vasion building up on Tech Ridge.
                This is the same venue we have used for the last several years.
                It fits several hundred people comfortably, and has plenty of
                space for everyone to spread out. There is a loft space inside
                the gym with couches for more seating (and sleeping) options.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                We will be able to open the large bay doors in the gym to let in
                fresh air as well as facilitate loading and unloading. We will
                mark off the street next to them specifically for loading and
                unloading. Please do not park in this area.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Please remember our venue is also an active workplace. Please do
                not disturb the employees of Vasion or any other tenants in the
                building during the event, especially on Friday while they are
                still in office. Do not enter any areas of the building that are
                not part of the event â€” they will be clearly marked so there are
                no excuses.

                are required to have a responsible person over the age of 21
                accompany you and/or your team. This responsible person doesn ot

                CodeCamp is a busy, noisy, and crowded event. If you have any
                concerns with this we encourage you to bring noise-cancelling
                headphones, earplugs, or any other tools you need to make

                multiple easy to find trash cans throughout the venue. Please
                use them. Vasion has been extremely kind to allow us to use
                their gym for the last several years and we want to make sure we
                leave it in better condition than we found it.
